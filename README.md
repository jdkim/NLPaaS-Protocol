Towards standardization of Web Service Protocols for NLPaaS

Several web services for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks (“NLP-as-a-service” or NLPaaS) have recently been made publicly available. However, despite their similar functionality these services often differ in the protocols they use, thus complicating the development of clients accessing them. A survey of currently available NLPaaS services suggests that it may be possible to identify a minimal application layer protocol that can be shared by NLPaaS services without sacrificing functionality or convenience, while at the same time simplifying the development of clients for these services. This repository is set up for the purpose of sharing relevant resources, and proposals for standardization of web service protocols of  NLPaaSIn this paper.
